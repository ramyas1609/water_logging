Water logging App

Welcome to water logging app! 

I tested the app on iphone 8 target in the simulator but the it should run on all ios devices. 

There are two tabs, the track tab ans visualize tab. 

The + button in the track tab updates today's number of glasses.

The visualize tab contains a graph of number of glasses logged in the past week. 
Everytime an additional glass of water is logged, the visualization is updated.
